During my undergrad at Duke, I was a part of [Duke Electric Vehicles](http://www.duke-ev.org/), a club that built vehicles to push the frontier of fuel efficiency. We were a completely student-led team of 15 undergrads. Our team competed in the [Shell Eco-Marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_Eco-marathon), where 100 teams annually compete to carry a driver a fixed distance using the smallest amount of fuel. These vehicles stretch the definition of a "car", and often only have three wheels are are just big enough to fit a small driver lying down. They have a limited top speed and no suspension. However, they push the absolute extreme of what is possible to build. While normal passenger cars often get 20-40 miles per gallon (MPG), these vehicles often get efficiencies above 1000 MPG.

I joined the team during my first year at Duke. I worked on, then eventually took charge of the vehicle's motor controller. This is a piece of power electronics that switches the DC from the battery to 3-phase AC for the vehicle's motor. Power electronics often blow up when things go wrong, which makes development an interesting process. During my third year, I was promoted to become the president of the team, where I took charge of the overall design of the car, management of the finances, and leadership of the team.

We got a blank slate when designing our next car, Maxwell.
