**I am looking for industry positions in computer vision and robotics starting August 2023.**

Hi! My name is Patrick; I'm currently a PhD student in the Robotics department at the Georgia Institute for Technology. I'm advised by [Charlie Kemp](https://charliekemp.com/), and closely work with [James Hays](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/). My research has been in computer vision and robotics, and my work has focused on understanding precisely how humans and robots manipulate the world through the lens of *contact*. I've had a great time interning with [Chengcheng Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WbG27wQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Chris Twigg](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aN-lQ0sAAAAJ&hl=en) of the Nimble team at Meta Reality Labs.

Before coming to Georgia Tech, I did my undergrad at Duke in computer science and electrical engineering. I got to lead [Duke Electric Vehicles](http://www.duke-ev.org/), a team of undergraduates building ultra-efficient cars. During my tenure as president, we set the world record for [Most Fuel-Efficient Vehicle](https://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/duke-students-break-guinness-world-record-fuel-efficiency) at 14,573 MPG, and [Most Efficient Electric Vehicle](https://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/duke-student-team-wins-second-guinness-world-record-vehicle-efficiency) at 27,482 MPGe.

In my free time, I like to fly gliders. These are a type of airplane without an engine which use thermals and mountain wave to stay aloft. My longest flight is 9 hours and covered 500 miles, and I hold 11 Georgia state records for soaring. It's a lot of fun! I also enjoy photography and building things with my hands.
